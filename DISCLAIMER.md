# AI Disclaimer

This project, **Laravel AI Provider**, provides a wrapper for various Artificial Intelligence (AI) models. By using this software, you acknowledge and agree to the following:

### 1. No Guarantee of Accuracy
AI models are known to "hallucinate" and may provide incorrect, incomplete, or biased information. The developers of this package do not guarantee the accuracy or reliability of any output generated by the AI providers integrated into this system.

### 2. Data Privacy & PII
While this package includes built-in PII (Personally Identifiable Information) masking and redaction tools, these tools are not infallible. 
- You are solely responsible for ensuring that sensitive data is handled in compliance with applicable laws (e.g., GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA).
- We strongly recommend using **Strict Mode** (scrubbing) for highly sensitive environments.
- Be aware that most AI providers log prompts and responses for training or safety purposes. Use local providers like Ollama if absolute data sovereignty is required.

### 3. Third-Party Provider Terms
This package interacts with third-party services (OpenAI, Anthropic, Google, Mistral, etc.). Your use of these services is governed by their respective Terms of Service and Privacy Policies. The developers of this package are not responsible for the actions, outages, or policy changes of these providers.

### 4. Zero Liability
To the maximum extent permitted by law, the authors and contributors of this package shall not be held liable for any damages—including but not limited to financial loss, data breaches, or legal repercussions—arising from the use or inability to use this software, even if advised of the possibility of such damages.

### 5. Security Responsibility
The user is responsible for implementing appropriate security measures, including but not limited to:
- Securely managing API keys.
- Validating and sanitizing AI-generated outputs before using them in critical systems or displaying them to end-users.
- Implementing rate limiting and cost monitoring.
